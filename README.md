Improvements

Photopile is still a pretty basic gallery. Wish list for future improvements includes:

* Improved navigation
 * LR arrow keys navigate to previous/next image in gallery
 * Clickable next/prev elements within the photo container to navigate to previous/next image in gallery
 * Clearly indicated 'close' button in photo container
* Display alt tags as photo description when a photo is picked up
* Draggable thumbnails
* Improved cross-browser support
