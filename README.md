Wish list
---------
Photopile is still a pretty bare gallery. Future improvements include:

* Improved navigation
 * L-R arrow clicks move to previous/next image in gallery
 * Addition of clickable next/prev elements within the photo container
* Display alt tags as photo description when in view
* Clearly indicated close button in photo container
* Improved cross-browser support
